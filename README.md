# Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) Prediction
This repository implements the best model for AGB inference described in:

**Sialelli, G., Peters, T., Wegner, J. D., and Schindler, K. (2025).** AGBD: A Global-scale Biomass Dataset. ISPRS Ann. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci., X-G-2025, 829–838. https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-X-G-2025-829-2025

## Google Earth Engine code to extract the input for your area of interest

Note: inputs, outputs, and pretrained weights may be large files so they are stored through LFS. Make sure you have that installed to be able to download everything.
If not working, you'll be able to find the pretrained weights here:...
